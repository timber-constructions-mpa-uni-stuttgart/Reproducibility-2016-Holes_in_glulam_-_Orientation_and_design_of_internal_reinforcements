Fitting of coefficients:
=========

This folder contains the python code used to obtain the coefficients _**c1**_, _**c2**_ and _**c3**_ for the Equation (4).
To use it, python [1] has to be installed in the system (in its version 3) and the following libraries must be present:

- ```numpy```
- ```scipy```
- ```matplotlib```
- ```pandas```
- ```seaborn```

The script will read the data obtained from the FE (stored in the folder ```data```) and use a optimization algorithm to find the coefficients.
The found values (c1, c2, c3) will be displayed on screen and a plot will show how good the fit is.
