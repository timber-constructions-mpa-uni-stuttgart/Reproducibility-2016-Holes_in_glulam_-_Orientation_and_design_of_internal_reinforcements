### Abstract:
The usage of holes in glulam and LVL beams is a common practice in timber constructions and requires in many cases the application of reinforcement.
At present, Eurocode 5 does not contain design rules for holes, nor for their reinforcement, which are, however, regulated in the German National Annex to EC5.
Although it has been proven that internal rod-like reinforcements improve the shear force capacity of a beam with holes, several problems still remain, particularly the inability to successfully reduce peak stresses at the periphery of the hole, especially shear stresses.
Inclined internal steel rod reinforcements were studied and compared with vertically oriented rods, which is currently the only regulated application.
The analysis revealed a reduction of both perpendicular to grain tensile stresses and shear stresses, which for the case of vertical rods are not reduced at all.
A first attempt at the design of such inclined reinforcements was made by deriving an equation based on the results from FEM simulations.
The design approach was then applied to an example case.
Experimental verification of the theoretical observations is still necessary and ongoing, though a very promising approach for an improved internal reinforcement and its respective design can already be observed.
